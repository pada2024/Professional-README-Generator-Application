## Challenges

-I was stuck with adding my tring literal to the index.js file and I reached out to 2 individuals for help. One told me I could not do it that way, but the second person understood my lne of thinking and helped me execte my original desired path in generating my README markdown. This really honed in on the there are many ways to code so don't get caught up on 1 thing and how dyanamic coding really is. I learned react was recently created by Facebook because someone got the bright idea to do something different and now that is being used by many major companies today. This empowered me to stick to my guns on somethings, but also not get to stuck n one way of doing it. 
- Research was a bit challenging because I was going down a rabit hole and finding to many ways to do a certain thing which ultimately confused me
- Generating a badge is hard and I'm hoping to get some help in office hours along with adding my Table of Contents. I could not figure out how to add it the proper way. I added the TOC as an inquirier prompt but doing that broke my entire code. I can see the TOC but it is labeled as "Undefined"
- I find my self thinking I understand and then I lose it because there are so many moving parts.
- License was challenfging as well because the AI instrucions wasn't clear for me. I tried to create a license on https://shields.io/ but kep getting a 404 error, without any context as to what more I needed to do.
